# Project Structure Lab

This is a super simple website with a few files. Each HTML file is a page in the site, but all the hyperlinks are missing!

Try to make this site useable:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone _your_ repository to your local computer.
3. Go through each file in your editor and add the correct URL to all of the tags with `TODO` comments.
5. Test out your changes in the browser. Can you click on each link to get to the right place? Can you see the right images?
6. When you finish a page, add the file and make a commit to save your work.
7. When you're done with all of them, push your changes to your repository and then submit a Pull Request to my original repository.

Good luck!
